# BUILD LAB — MyWebsite

Welcome to **BUILD LAB**, the central hub for all my code, professional projects, and creative work.  
This repository serves as the source for my personal website: [beckettfrey.com](https://beckettfrey.com).

---

## About

**BUILD LAB** is my take on a portfolio, gitfolio, or personal website — all in one.  
I wanted a space that's a bit more personal and flexible than the typical developer portfolio,  
where I can showcase projects, share ideas, and experiment with new features.

---

## Mission

- **Centralize** all my projects and professional work in one place.
- **Personalize** the experience beyond a standard portfolio.
- **Open Source** so others can learn from or adapt the approach.

---

## Project Structure

- **Frontend:**  
    All site logic and content loading is handled in the [`frontend/`](frontend/) directory.  
    There is **no backend** - the frontend fetches all content from a remote `config.json` file in a GitHub repository you control.

## Usage & Customization

If you're interested in using or adapting this project for your own site,  
please see the [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md) for setup, configuration, and customization instructions.

A local configuration file, [`./config.json`](./config.json), is used to manage site-specific settings.  
For more information on configuration, refer to the [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md).
