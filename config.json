This is my portfolio, I wanted to create something that was slightly more informative than the typical static portfolio, so I've been working on this to showcase my projects and let whoever's watching get to know me a little better especially perspective employers and clients. I love building things end to end, from the initial concept to the final deployment. So far my journey in tech has been fueled by a love for problem-solving and a fascination with the ever-evolving world of computer technology.
