# MyWebsite Frontend

This is the frontend for **MyWebsite**, a dynamic portfolio and project showcase built with React.  
It loads configuration and content dynamically from a remote JSON file, allowing you to update your site without redeploying.

## Features

- **Dynamic Portfolio:** Projects, about info, and more are loaded from a remote JSON config.
- **Contact Form:** Integrated with Formspree.
- **Games & Interactive Pages:** Easily add custom pages or games.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS for modern, mobile-friendly layouts.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Add assets:**
   - Place your favicon at: `public/favicon.ico`
   - Place your profile image at: `src/assets/profile.png`
   - Place your background image at: `public/desktop_background.png` (optional)

3. **Configure environment variables:**  
   Create a `.env` file in the root of `frontend/` with the following content (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your `frontend/` directory:

```env
# Contact Form Configuration
VITE_FORMSPREE_CODE=your-formspree-code

# LinkedIn URL
VITE_LINKEDIN_URL=https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-linkedin

# GitHub Profile (for consistency across pages)
VITE_GITHUB_USERNAME=your-github-username

# Portfolio Configuration repo
VITE_PORTFOLIO_CONFIG_REPO=your-config-repo
```

- **Note:**  
  The app fetches its configuration from  
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[VITE_GITHUB_USERNAME]/[VITE_PORTFOLIO_CONFIG_REPO]/src/config.json`

---

## Required Assets

- `public/favicon.ico` â€” Your site favicon.
- `src/assets/profile.png` â€” Your profile picture (displayed on the About page).

---

## Dynamic Configuration

**This app does NOT store portfolio content in the build.**  
Instead, it fetches all content from a remote `config.json` file in a GitHub repository you control.

### How it works

- Set `VITE_GITHUB_USERNAME` and `VITE_PORTFOLIO_CONFIG_REPO` in your `.env`.
- Create a public repository (e.g., `portfolio-config`) on your GitHub.
- Add a `config.json` file at the root of that repo.
- The frontend will fetch and use this file for all portfolio content.
